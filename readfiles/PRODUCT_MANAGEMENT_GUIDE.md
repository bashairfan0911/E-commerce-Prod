   - First image should be the best product shot

2. **Pricing**
   - Ensure selling price is less than original price

   - Formula: `discount = ((originalPrice - sellingPrice) / originalPrice) * 100`

3. **Descriptions**
   - Write clear, detailed descriptions
   - Include key features and benefits
   - Mention any special attributes (organic, fresh, etc.)

4. **Stock Management**
   - Keep stock numbers updated
   - Products with 0 stock can still be viewed but may show "Out of Stock"

5. **Categories**
   - Create all necessary categories before adding products
   - Use clear, descriptive category names
   - Categories help customers find products easily
